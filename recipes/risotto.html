    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>4 blibs fennel</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cups uncooked Arborio rice</li>
      <li>7 cups vegetable broth</li>

        Cut the base off of the fennel blibs, and cut a cone shape into the base

        and fennel in butter for 2 minutes. Stir in the rice; cook for another 2
        minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted. Stir in 1 cup
        vegetable broth; continue stirring until liquid is almost completely
        absorbed. Repeat this process with remaining broth, stirring constantly.

        pepper. Divide risotto among 6 bowls, and sprinkle with remaining
        cheese.
